### 👋 Hi, I'm Jonathan Guaynora

I'm a software developer mainly focused on **building mobile apps with React Native**. I’m passionate about crafting smooth, intuitive, and accessible user experiences. While I’ve also worked with web and backend technologies, my core interest lies in mobile development and continuous learning.

Currently, I contribute to real-world projects across both frontend and backend, working with tools like **GraphQL**, **NestJS**, and **Prisma**, while deepening my understanding of software development best practices.

In my day-to-day workflow, I use **Neovim** as my main code editor — customized with **LazyVim**, testing plugins, and productivity tools — which helps me stay fast and focused while coding.
